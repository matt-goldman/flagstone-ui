**POC Progress**: ~60% Complete  
**Note**: MVP milestone will follow after POC validation

### Current Focus 🎯

#### Alignment with .NET 10 Launch (November 12, 2025)

The project is being positioned as a **preview/experimental release** to coincide with the .NET 10 launch. The focus has shifted from building more controls to demonstrating the **unique value proposition**: CSS/Tailwind-to-XAML theme conversion tooling.

**Strategic Decision**: MCP tooling development is being prioritized because:

1. Control libraries are commodities - theming automation is differentiation
2. .NET 10 launch provides high-visibility opportunity
3. Theme switching demonstration requires conversion tooling anyway
4. MVP control coverage (Entry, Button, Card) is sufficient to prove the concept
5. Tooling validates architecture before expanding control library

### Next Milestone: Bootstrap Theme Converter 🚀

**Target**: Functional MCP tool by .NET 10 launch (November 12, 2025)

- [ ] **Bootstrap → Flagstone MCP Tool**
  - Parse Bootstrap `_variables.scss` or CSS custom properties
  - Generate `Tokens.xaml` with mapped colors, spacing, typography
  - Generate theme variant (Bootstrap.xaml) or modify Material theme
  - Document mapping strategy and supported variables

- [ ] **Theme Switching Demo**
  - Toggle between Material/Modern/Bootstrap-converted themes
  - Demonstrate runtime theme switching
  - Lives in ThemePlayground sample app

- [ ] **Preview Release Documentation**
  - Bootstrap converter usage guide
  - Theme conversion examples
  - MCP tool integration instructions
  - Known limitations and roadmap

**Post-.NET 10 Priorities**:

1. Control property audit (document gap analysis)
2. Tailwind → XAML MCP tool (more complex, post-validation)
3. Additional controls based on MCP tooling insights

### Current Blockers 🚫
